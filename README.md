# Minh Quang's MovieFlix

Hello! I am Minh Quang and this repo hosts my personal MovieFlix experiment. The goal is to deliver a fast, modern movie browsing experience built with React, Vite, and a clean TypeScript codebase that I can iterate on quickly.

## Highlights
- Hero slider showcases trending titles with smooth transitions
- Detail pages bundle trailers, storylines, and related picks
- Instant search, clear pagination, and gentle loading states
- Client-side routing powered by React Router DOM v7

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with TypeScript for strong typing
- Vite 6 for fast dev server and optimized builds
- Utility-first styling approach for flexible layouts
- Centralized API helpers inside `services/api.ts`

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MinhQuang-02/movie.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Add your Gemini key in `.env.local` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Roadmap
- Add authentication and a personal watchlist
- Expand data sources to include Vietnamese movie catalogs
- Introduce a theme switcher with a polished dark mode
